This repo is cloned from [binius gitlab repo by Irreducible](https://gitlab.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius) This integrates [bitsliced groestl](https://github.com/FawadHa1der/custom_groestl). Which is added as submodule to the hash crate.
The [tensor_pcs](https://github.com/FawadHa1der/binius_bs_groestl/blob/main/crates/core/src/poly_commit/tensor_pcs.rs) has been been updated to use the new bitsliced groestl.
Running the [keccak](https://github.com/FawadHa1der/binius_bs_groestl/blob/main/examples/keccakf.rs) will print/compare the time taken by each variant of the hash(bitsliced 
vs the original)

Benchmarks WIP.

# Binius

Binius is a Rust library implementing a cryptographic *succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge* (SNARK) over towers of binary fields. The techniques are described formally in the paper *[Succinct Arguments over Towers of Binary Fields](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1784)*.

This library is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for use, but may be of interest for experimentation. 

## Usage

At this stage, the primary interfaces are the unit tests and benchmarks. The benchmarks use the [criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/0.3.4/criterion/) library.

To run the benchmarks, use the command `cargo bench`. To run the unit tests, use the command `cargo test`.

Binius implements optimizations for certain target architectures. To enable these, export the environment variable

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
```

Binius has notable optimizations on Intel processors featuring the [Galois Field New Instructions](https://networkbuilders.intel.com/solutionslibrary/galois-field-new-instructions-gfni-technology-guide) (GFNI) instruction set extension. To determine if your processor supports this feature, run

```bash
rustc --print cfg -C target-cpu=native | grep gfni
```

If the output of the command above is empty, the processor does not support these instructions.

### Examples

There are examples of simple commit-and-prove SNARKs in the `examples` directory. For example, you may run

```bash
cargo run --release --example bitwise_and_proof
```

To print out profiling information, set the environment variable `PROFILE_PRINT_TREE=1`:

```bash
PROFILE_PRINT_TREE=1 cargo run --release --example bitwise_and_proof
```

The environment variable `PROFILE_CSV_FILE` can be set to an output filename to dump profiling data to a CSV file for more detailed analysis.

## Support

This project is under active development. The developers with make breaking changes at will. Any modules that are stabilized will be explicitly documented as such.

We use GitLab's issue system for tracking bugs, features, and other development tasks.

This codebase certainly contains many bugs at this point in its development. *We discourage the production use of this library until future notice.* Any bugs, including those affecting the security of the system, may be filed publicly as an issue.
